    'about_description' => '<p>The project to create Burundi Adventist University (BAU) has been in the works for a long time. It was born from the shared inspiration of members and the administration of the Seventh-day Adventist Church both in Burundi and within the East-Central Africa Division. The Church, having been active in education through elementary and secondary schools, now wishes to contribute to the training of Burundian university students, both local and international.</p>' .
        '<p>BAU aims to provide a solid education that enables students to develop intellectually, morally, socially, physically and spiritually for the advancement of themselves, their country of Burundi and the world at large. Opening this university also responds to members of the Adventist Church who, according to their beliefs, cannot study at institutions that hold classes on Saturday.</p>' .
        '<p>The university will operate two campuses: one at Jabe in Mukaza commune, Bwiza zone, and the main campus at Kivoga in Bujumbura province, Mutimbuzi commune. From the outset, BAU plans to be bilingual, using French or English as the language of instruction depending on the course, since these languages are widely used in Africa.</p>' .
        '<p>All lecturers at BAU must use PowerPoint presentations in class and post their notes on Moodle so every student has access. Moodle will also be used to publish assessment results and answer keys, ensuring the consistency of examinations.</p>' .
        '<p>BAU intends to establish both a physical and a virtual library. The physical library will host printed books while the virtual library will provide electronic resources. Students are encouraged to learn typing in their first year so they can prepare their own assignments; typing exercises will be available in the computer lab.</p>' .
        '<p>To maintain quality education, enrollment will be limited to avoid overcrowded classes. Dormitories and a cafeteria will be available on the Kivoga campus, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>' .
        '<h2>Vision</h2>' .
        '<p>The vision of Burundi Adventist University is to provide high-quality higher education. We aim to make the university a center of excellence where knowledge and skills support transformation and productivity in society. Training will instill integrity, initiative, perseverance and adaptability, enabling students to compete in the job market and assume responsibilities.</p>' .
        '<h2>Mission</h2>' .
        '<ul>' .
        '    <li>Offer holistic and distinctive Christian education that makes students contributors to national development.</li>' .
        '    <li>Develop in students, through study and research, a disposition to dedicate their lives to serving God and humanity with integrity.</li>' .

    'history_content' => 'The project to create the Burundi Adventist University (BUA) dates back a long time and comes at just the right moment. It was born from the joint inspiration of members and the Administration of the Seventh-day Adventist Church both in Burundi and at the East-Central Africa Division level. Indeed, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, having intervened in the field of Education through Fundamental and Post-Fundamental Schools, wants to contribute to the training of young Burundian university students, both residents and internationals.<br><br>BUA, through its goal of providing solid education, will enable students to develop intellectual, moral, social, physical and spiritual faculties for their own development, that of their country - Burundi - and the world in general, where these students will evolve after their studies. Moreover, the opening of this University will also be a response to members of the Adventist Church who, according to their beliefs, cannot study in universities that organize their classes on Saturdays.<br><br>BUA will have two campuses: the Jabe campus, located in the commune of MUKAZA Zone BWIZA, and the main campus of KIVOGA, in BUJUMBURA province in the commune of MUTIMBUZI. Furthermore, BUA is determined from the outset to be bilingual, using French or English as the language of instruction depending on the courses, given that these two languages are widely used on the African continent.<br><br>All professors at BUA will be required to use PPT projection during lectures and all notes will be posted on Moodle for accessibility to all concerned students. Moreover, Moodle will serve as a link to post the results of given evaluations and corrections in each course. This will also allow verification of the consistency of the tests performed.<br><br>Furthermore, BUA proposes to establish a physical and virtual library. The physical library will have paper books while the virtual library will provide documents in electronic version. Each student will be encouraged to learn typing from the first year in order to be able to type their own work. To this end, typing exercises will be placed in the computer lab so that each student can use them during free time.<br><br>It should also be noted that in order to maintain quality education, places will always be limited to avoid overcrowded classes.<br><br>Finally, BUA will have dormitories for student accommodation at the Kivoga campus and a cafeteria, but places will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis and by priority.',
