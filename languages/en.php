<p>The project to create Burundi Adventist University (BAU) has been in the works for a long time. It was born from the shared inspiration of members and the administration of the Seventh-day Adventist Church both in Burundi and within the East-Central Africa Division. The Church, having been active in education through elementary and secondary schools, now wishes to contribute to the training of Burundian university students, both local and international.</p>
<p>BAU aims to provide a solid education that enables students to develop intellectually, morally, socially, physically and spiritually for the advancement of themselves, their country of Burundi and the world at large. Opening this university also responds to members of the Adventist Church who, according to their beliefs, cannot study at institutions that hold classes on Saturday.</p>
<p>The university will operate two campuses: one at Jabe in Mukaza commune, Bwiza zone, and the main campus at Kivoga in Bujumbura province, Mutimbuzi commune. From the outset, BAU plans to be bilingual, using French or English as the language of instruction depending on the course, since these languages are widely used in Africa.</p>
<p>All lecturers at BAU must use PowerPoint presentations in class and post their notes on Moodle so every student has access. Moodle will also be used to publish assessment results and answer keys, ensuring the consistency of examinations.</p>
<p>BAU intends to establish both a physical and a virtual library. The physical library will host printed books while the virtual library will provide electronic resources. Students are encouraged to learn typing in their first year so they can prepare their own assignments; typing exercises will be available in the computer lab.</p>
<p>To maintain quality education, enrollment will be limited to avoid overcrowded classes. Dormitories and a cafeteria will be available on the Kivoga campus, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>The vision of Burundi Adventist University is to provide high-quality higher education. We aim to make the university a center of excellence where knowledge and skills support transformation and productivity in society. Training will instill integrity, initiative, perseverance and adaptability, enabling students to compete in the job market and assume responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Offer holistic and distinctive Christian education that makes students contributors to national development.</li>
    <li>Develop in students, through study and research, a disposition to dedicate their lives to serving God and humanity with integrity.</li>
    <li>Prepare students through quality training to face environmental challenges and become agents of positive change, convinced they have something to contribute to humanity.</li>
    <li>Provide exceptional holistic Christian education—physical, intellectual, moral, social, spiritual and professional—equipping young men and women with skills for quality service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Objective</h2>
<p>BAU seeks to produce graduates with the expertise, motivation and critical thinking needed to solve problems effectively. The goal is men and women of high integrity who continually pursue excellence and have a clear worldview, ready for service in Burundi and beyond.</p>
